Basic array description with Jupyter and Numpy
Hii friends here is the basics of array description via python codes with Numpy and jupyter 
there are two files including both description various array
 
 This code demonstrates the creation of arrays, performing basic arithmetic operations,
 matrix multiplication, array transpose, reshaping, and some statistical operations using NumPy.
 You can run this code to see the output and experiment further with NumPy functionalities.
 This code showcases how to create and manipulate complex arrays in NumPy.   
 It demonstrates accessing the real and imaginary parts, performing complex arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), 
 calculating the complex conjugate, and obtaining the magnitude and phase of complex numbers.  
 Feel free to run this code and explore more complex number operations in NumPy.
